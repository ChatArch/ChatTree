# CLI Tree

`ChatTree` is currently a root-only CLI. It uses the shared `chatstyle.add_tree_option()` integration to generate both trees from the registered Click command surface:

- `chattree --tree` includes parameter signatures for interface review.
- `chattree --tree-brief` keeps the same nodes and descriptions while omitting signatures.

There are no business-command parameters yet, so the full and brief views are identical. This page must not invent future commands; the template `hello` command is not part of the public interface.

## Full command tree

```text
chattree
├── --help  # Show this message and exit.
├── --version  # Show the version and exit.
├── --tree  # Print the registered CLI tree and exit.
└── --tree-brief  # Print the registered CLI tree without parameter signatures and exit.
```

## Brief command tree

```text
chattree
├── --help  # Show this message and exit.
├── --version  # Show the version and exit.
├── --tree  # Print the registered CLI tree and exit.
└── --tree-brief  # Print the registered CLI tree without parameter signatures and exit.
```

## Status Contract

- `chattree --help` must expose `--tree` and `--tree-brief`.
- `chattree --tree` must exit 0 and show the registered surface with parameter signatures.
- `chattree --tree-brief` must exit 0 and show the same surface without signatures.
- `chattree hello` must fail; `hello` is not a business command.
- The current entrypoint only prints text; it does not read or mutate project trees or print/store sensitive values.
- Future tree capabilities must add reusable Python APIs first, then CLI commands, and then update both trees.
